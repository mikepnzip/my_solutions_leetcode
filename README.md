# LeetCode Solutions by mikepnzip

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! This project contains my solutions to 70 LeetCode problems, all implemented in **Java**. I initially solved some problems in C but later rewrote them in Java to deepen my understanding and align with my focus on backend development.

## LeetCode Stats

- **Total Problems Solved**: 70
- **Languages Used**: Java (all solutions are now in Java)

## Repository Structure

- The solutions are organized into two main folders:
  - `C/`: Contains my initial solutions written in C.
  - `Java/`: Contains all 70 solutions rewritten in Java.
- Inside each folder, solutions are grouped into subfolders named like `problem_name123`, where `123` is the LeetCode problem number.
- Each subfolder contains the solution code.

## How to Navigate

1. Browse the `C/` or `Java/` directories to find solutions.
2. Look for subfolders like `problem_name123` to locate specific problems.
3. Feel free to explore and provide feedback!
